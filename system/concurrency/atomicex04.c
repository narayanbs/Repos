/*
 * modifying a struct atomically in C language
 * But Here's the Catch:
 * Atomicity depends on the size and alignment of the struct.
 * The compiler and hardware must support atomic operations on objects of that size.
 * If the struct is too large or not properly aligned, atomic operations might not be lock-free,
 * or might not even be supported.
 *
 * You cannot do atomic operations on individual members of the struct via the atomic struct.
 * for ex: p.x = 20;
 *
 * if you want to modify individual members atomically, you have to make each member atomic:
 * typedef struct {
 *   atomic_int x;
 *   atomic_int y;
 * } AtomicPoint;
 *
 * Then you can do
 * atomic_store(&point.x, 5); // âœ… atomic
 *
